2. PreprocessPurchaseOrder

Should read canonical purchase orders from the Service Bus topic subscription configured for received orders.
The workflow must perform preprocessing tasks, including XML validation and a check for stock availability for each item in the order.

Validate the canonical PurchaseOrder XML against the schema PurchaseOrder.xsd.
If validation fails, mark the order as invalid and move it to the failed orders topic keeping "orderSource" user property and adding 
"orderStatus" ("Received") and "failReason" ("Invalid").

Stock Check: for each item in the order, check if the required quantity of the item is available. 
Currently the interaction with the stock service can be simulated/emulated by comparing required amount with random numbers.

If stock for all items is available, send the original canonical order to the preprocessed orders topic (preprocessedorders).
Add user properties to the Service Bus message, preserving properties from the original message.

If any item has insufficient stock, mark the order as failed and move it to the failed orders topic 
with the "failReason" set to "NoStock".

Regardless of whether the order was successfully preprocessed or marked as failed, delete the original received order message from the Service Bus subscription.

If a server or workflow error occurs, notify the team and return appropriate error information (if applicable).
