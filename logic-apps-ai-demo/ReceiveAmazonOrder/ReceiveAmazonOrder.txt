1.1. ReceiveAmazonOrder
Workflow should be triggered by HTTP POST request with body containing Amazon Purchase Order xml.
Need to validate the payload against the AmazonPurchaseOrder.xsd schema. 

Orders from Amazon should be uploaded to blob storage for archiving, grouped by current date.
Blob name should be equal to Amazon's Order ID. If exists, the blob should be overwritten.

Then order need to be transformed into canonical schema using xslt which also should assign a new unique (Guid) 
order id.

The canonical order need to be sent to service bus topic for received orders.
Service bus message should have user property "OrderSource" indicating from which online store the order came.

Should return HTTP 200 response containg the assigned Canonical OrderID.

In case of an error, should return appropriate Http status and short error description if possible.
