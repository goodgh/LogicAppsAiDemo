Order processing is implemented by moving an order between topics in service bus and performing required actions on each stage.
Topics involved into order processing are (to be appended):
ReceivedOrders
	subscriptions: all-orders;
PreprocessedOrders 
	subscriptions: all-orders;
FailedOrders 
	subscriptions: received-invalid, received-no-stock.

Ebay specific service bus queue for notification purposes: ebayOrderReceiveNotification.

For configuring service bus related workflow actions, the following connection should be used:
"serviceProviderConfiguration": {
                        "connectionName": "serviceBus-1",
                        "operationId": <as needed>,
                        "serviceProviderId": "/serviceProviders/serviceBus"
                    }

Storage account used by order processing: storacclogicappsaidemo.

Amazon-specific archive blob container: amazon-received-orders-archive.
For configuring blob storage related workflow actions, the following connection should be used:
"serviceProviderConfiguration": {
                        "connectionName": "AzureBlob-1",
                        "operationId": <as needed>,
                        "serviceProviderId": "/serviceProviders/AzureBlob"
                    }					

Workflows shouldn't hardcode such values as service bus topic/queue/subscription names, blob container name etc.
Instead, they should be provided as workflow parameters.

Workflow action name should reflect it's type and purpose but still remain compact.

Promoted properties used for filtering/routing:
schema-based:
- orderSource (Amazon, eBay, AliExpress)
- eBayOrderId (for eBay only)
- CustomerEmail (for eBay only)

not schema-based:
- orderStatus (Received, Preprocessed, to be appended)
- ProductsNumber (for Ali only)
- failReason (Invalid, NoStock, to be appended)

Known xml schemas:
PurchaseOrder.xsd
EbayPurchaseOrder.xsd
AmazonPurchaseOrder.xsd
AliPurchaseOrder.xsd

Known xsl transformations:
AliPO_to_PurchaseOrder.xslt
AmazonPO_to_PurchaseOrder.xslt
EbayPO_to_PurchaseOrder.xslt
Map names usually follow the convention <SourceSchema>_to_<TargetSchema>. However, commonly used shortenings are possible like PO = PurchaseOrder.
