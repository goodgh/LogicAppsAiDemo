1.2. ReceiveEbayOrder
Workflow should be triggered by an HTTP POST request with a body containing eBay Purchase Order XML.
The payload should be validated against the EbayPurchaseOrder.xsd schema.

Once validated, the eBay order should be sent to a Service Bus queue to trigger sending a notification process.
The following user properties should be provided: 
- eBayOrderId: eBay's specific Order ID from the incoming XML.
- CustomerEmail: Contact email of the buyer from the eBay Purchase Order XML.

Then, the incoming eBay order needs to be transformed into the canonical PurchaseOrder schema using XSLT (EbayPO_to_PurchaseOrder.xslt).
The transformation should also generate a unique (GUID-based) Canonical Order ID.

The transformed Canonical PurchaseOrder XML must be sent to the Service Bus topic for received orders.
The Service Bus message should have a user property OrderSource that specifies eBay as the origin of the order.

The workflow should return an HTTP 200 response containing the assigned Canonical Order ID.

In case of an error:
- If XML validation fails, return HTTP 400 (Bad Request).
- If a server or workflow error occurs, return HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) with a short error description, if possible.
