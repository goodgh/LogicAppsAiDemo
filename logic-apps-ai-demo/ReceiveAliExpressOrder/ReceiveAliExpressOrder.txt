1.3. ReceiveAliExpressOrder
Receive AliExpress Purchase Order XML as a payload of HTTP POST request.
Validate it against the AliPurchaseOrder.xsd schema.

The order needs to be transformed into the canonical PurchaseOrder schema using XSLT (AliPO_to_PurchaseOrder.xslt).
The transformation should also assign a unique (GUID-based) Canonical Order ID to the order.

The workflow should also count the number of products positions in the order (based on <Items><Item> elements in the transformed order)
and expose it as user property "ProductsNumber" when sending purchase order to service bus topic for received orders.
Also "OrderSource" property should be exposed.

The workflow should return an HTTP 200 response containing the assigned Canonical Order ID.

In case of an error:
- If XML validation fails, return HTTP 400 (Bad Request).
- If a server or workflow error occurs, return HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) with a short error description if possible."
